# Test repo for [woorelease](https://github.com/woocommerce/woorelease)

`woorelease` misses all PRs that were merged to a different branch that's being released.
That applies to 
- feature branches
- PRs made to other PRs
- Releasing from `release/*` branch

## Steps to reproduce

1. Release `1.0.0` from `develop` (manually, as you [cannot do that with the woorelease either](https://github.com/woorelease-bugs/initial-release))
2. Marge a PR directly to `develop`, with a changelog note

### Feature branches
3. Create a (feature) branch, like `add/foo`, with a commit
4. Create a PR to merge `add/foo` to `develop`, with a changelog note
5. Create another branch `add/bar` with a commit, and a PR to `add/foo` with a changelog note
6. Merge the PR `add/bar` to `add/foo`
7. Merge the PR `add/foo` to `develop`
8. Try releasing `1.0.1` from `develop`
	```
	woorelease cl:generate --product_version=1.0.1 https://github.com/woorelease-bugs/pr-to-branch/tree/develop
	```	
	```= 1.0.1 - 2022-06-17 =
	* Add - README description directly to develop.
	* Add - a workflow to attach label based on PR branchname directly to `develop`.
	```

9. Use https://github.com/woorelease-bugs/pr-to-branch/releases/new?tag=1.0.1&branch=develop "Generate release notes" instead 
	```

	```



## Release branches
3. `git checkout -b release/1.0.1` on the head of `develop`
4. `git push origin release/1.0.1`
5. Try releasing `1.0.1` from `release/1.0.1`
	```
	woorelease cl:generate --product_version=1.0.1 https://github.com/woorelease-bugs/pr-to-branch/tree/release/1.0.1
